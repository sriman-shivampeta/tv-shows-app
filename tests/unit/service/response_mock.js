I designed the Machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything. Violent crimes involving ordinary people. People like you. Crimes the government considered \"irrelevant\". They wouldn't act so I decided I would. But I needed a partner. Someone with the skills to intervene. Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. You'll never find us. But victim or perpetrator, if your number is up, we'll find you.</p>",

They wouldn't act so I decided I would. But I needed a partner. Someone with the skills to intervene. Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. You'll never find us.

The creator of groundbreaking documentaries like <i>The Thin Blue Line</i> and <i>The Fog of War</i>, he's turned his patented \"Interrotron\" on many a subject, getting them to explain their life and their philosophy for the camera. Now, in <b>First Person</b>, he combines Megatron interviews and stock footage to create a 24-minute profile of characters both fascinating and bizarre. Objectivity has been thrown wholesale right out the window. You're out there alone, utterly alone. All we can do is urge you to watch and wish you good luck.</p>",
